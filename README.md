Image compression using DCT impelemted in python with basic interface using tkinter in python
Iâ€™ve used  Discrete Cosine Transform which is also adequate for most compression applications.The discrete cosine transform (DCT) is a mathematical function that transforms digital image data from the spatial domain to the frequency domain.

When the program is executed, it loads a simple GUI which primarily asks the user to enter the name of the image . After entering image name user can compress the image by pressing compress button

When user press Compress button it starts to compress the photo. After the completion of compressing, the user is given information about compression such as time taken, original image size, compressed file size.

# Note: It generates output in grayscale

# Requirements:

1. python 3.6 or higher
2. tkinter (To build GUI)
3. Opencv-python (Computer Vision Library). 
4. PIL (Python Imaging Library). 
5. OS (Python Library to Interact with Operating System). 
6. Time (Python Library to record run-time).

# How to use:
1. clone the file into your system 
2. open it with any editor 
3. run img-compression.py
4. make sure the image is present in same directory enter the image name and press on compress
5. the image will be compresssed and stored as image.txt
6. press decompress to get decompressed image frm txt file and wilb be stored uncompress_img.png
