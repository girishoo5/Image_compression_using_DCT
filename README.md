image compressing using dct impelemted in python with basic interface using tkinter in python
Iâ€™ve used  Discrete Cosine Transform which is also adequate for most compression applications. The discrete cosine transform (DCT) is a mathematical function that transforms digital image data from the spatial domain to the frequency domain.

==================================================================================
When the program is executed, it loads a simple GUI which primarily asks the user to enter the name of the image . After entering image name user can compress the image by pressing compress button

When user press Compress button it starts to compress the photo. After the
completion of compressing, the user is given information about compression such
as time taken, original image size, compressed file size.

==================================================================================
# note: it generates output in grayscale


# requirements:
1.tkinter
2.python3.6
==================================================================================
# How to use:
1.clone d file into ur system 
2.open it in visual studio or any editor 
3.run img-compression.py
4.make sure the image is present in same directory enter d image name and press on compress
5.the image wil be compresssed and stored as image.txt
6.press decompress to get decompressed image frm txt file
